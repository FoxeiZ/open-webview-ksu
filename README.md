# Open WebView KSU

![Open WebView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoxeiZ/open-webview-ksu/main/img/logo.png)

This script helps you create the module to replace your system webview though KernelSU.

>**ATTENTION!** There is a bug that still needs to be fixed where sometimes you may find that the installed webview doesn't work. To fix this bug you need to manually install the webview, to do this just:<br/><br/>- go to fdroid and re-download the latest version<br/>- manually download the apk and install it

## Compatibility

- Android 8+
- KernelSU v0.6.1+ (11041)

## Tested Device

- [LOS 20](https://lineageos.org/)
- [Corvus](https://github.com/Corvus-AOSP)
- And more...
